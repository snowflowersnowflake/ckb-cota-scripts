The Compact Token Aggregator Standard type scripts implement of [[RFC] CoTA: A Compact Token Aggregator Standard for Extremely Low Cost NFTs and FTs](https://talk.nervos.org/t/rfc-cota-a-compact-token-aggregator-standard-for-extremely-low-cost-nfts-and-fts/6338) on [Nervos CKB](https://www.nervos.org/).

## Pre-requirement

- [capsule](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/capsule) >= 0.7.1
- [ckb-cli](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-cli) >= 0.100.0

> Note: Capsule uses docker to build contracts and run tests. https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
> and docker and ckb-cli must be accessible in the PATH in order for them to be used by Capsule.

## Getting Started

```sh
make build
```

Run tests:

```

## Deployment

The release version of script doesnâ€™t include debug symbols which makes the size smaller.

```
